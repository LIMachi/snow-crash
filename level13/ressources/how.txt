Since we cannot emulate our uid before executing the program we need to find a way to pass the test getuid == 4242

Run the program with gdb

(gdb) b main
(gdb) r
(gdb) dissasemble main

Watch for where getuid is called and compare (cmp ou strcmp)

Set a Breakpoint Right Before the cmp :

(gdb) b *0x9234729342
(gdb) continue

Change je (jump if equal) to jmp (jump)

(gdb) set {char}0x0804859f = 0xeb
(gdb) c
