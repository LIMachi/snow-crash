tries:
ls, pwd, cd .. (up to root), ls, find -name "pass" (garbage), find -name "pass" 2>&1 | grep -v "denied" (more readable),
tried with token, pas, flag, level and usr,
tried with find -user "level00", then "flag00", got something (paths: /usr/sbin/john, /rofs/usr/sbin/john),
can't get to /usr/sbin/john (access denied),
can ls in /rofs !
cat /rofs/usr/sbin/john
cdiiddwpgswtgt
tried to su into flag00 (as shown in the example)
failure
searching cipher techniques (the password is probably encoded in some way)
got to https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier
tried most of them, can't find a valid (readable output), I expect the school to have put some whity joke as a password, but I'm not sure anymore
trying the cipher teached at 42... (ft_ssl_des)
base64 gives nothing, caesar either... but I realised I didn't try the most obvious shift option of 42...
the output of caesar with a shift of 42 is: nottoohardhere
su flag00 with nottoohardhere, we got in
run getflag -> x24ti5gi3xOo12esiuxias
since copy past is out of the question in such a basic terminal, I will need to use a command to extract this flag and use it as the password for level01
getflag | awk '{print $NF}' > /tmp/level01
didn't work (i don't know how to send this file to su, guess I'll have to get the ssh connection working)
got ssh working (had to setup a local network)
level00 complete, onto level01
