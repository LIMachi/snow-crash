let's use the same technique:
find / -user "flag01" 2>&1 | grep -v "denied"
no match :(
"level01" gives nothing either...
we still can't ls /home/user/
we still have access to /rofs/
searching inspiration in man find
can't find anything usefull
might be dumb at this point, but search how passwords are stored on linux
Oh crap, my find command was not using partial matches when I searched "pass" (should have used -iname '*pass*' to get more results)
I found a lot of password files, time to check them all...
or make a script to search level01 and flag01 keyword in all of them instead? let's do that.
I wrote it on my own machine first (see script.sh), then use scp to copy it into the vm (we have creation right on /tmp): scp -P 4242 script.sh level00@192.168.56.101:/tmp/script.sh
the file was copied, but I can't execute it :(
let's try another way, I chmod my script locally (777 because we can't be bothered)
then try to use rsync instead of scp
rsync -av -e 'ssh -p 4242' script.sh level00@192.168.56.101:/tmp/script.sh
this time ls -l /tmp/script.sh shows that the file has full rights!
nothing matches...
it seem's my find was at fault again, I have access to /etc/passwd but it was not listed in my find (and flag01 has an extra field: 42hDRfypTqqnw)
