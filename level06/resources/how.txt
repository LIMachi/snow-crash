similar to level03, we have an elf (compiled) executable, and we also have a readable php file
running the executable shows an error (can't open a file without name)
inputting a valid file name seems to show the content of the file but with weird repetition (used level06.php as an input)
after running string on the elf, we might assume that it calls the php for some reason
we can see that the php expect 2 inputs, but discard the second and do some regex replacement on the first
(specifically, that any string that is inside square brackets and starting with a x and separated by spaces will be transformed to y(<something>), a call to the y function)
so we can input any string of the format `[x <something>]` and we get <something> as an output
(echo "[x test]" > /tmp/test; ./level06 /tmp/test -> test)
now comes the hard part, we tried many strings like shell_exec(getflag) to no avail
desperate, we tri [x $getflag] and we get an error message telling us that getflag is not a valid variable
after searching how to manipulate string in php, we end up on this part of the documentation:
https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.parsing.advanced
and after tinkering around with various configuration of culry braces, we ended up with an error message showing the flag when we input "[x {${shell_exec(getflag)}}]"
echo '[x {${shell_exec(getflag)}}]' > /tmp/test; ./level06 /tmp/test -> PHP Notice:  Undefined variable: Check flag.Here is your token : wiok45aaoguiboiki2tuin6ub
